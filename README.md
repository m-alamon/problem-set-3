PROBLEM SET #3: EVALUATION METRICS

Instructions:

- Clone the Problem Set code package from GitHub:
- You will use two CSV files already included in the `data/` directory
   - Remember to spend some time to get to know the data before you start on pre-processing and analysis
- Each of the .py files in /src contain instructions for the exepected code you are to write

Before you start:

- Make sure to setup a virtual environment as discussed in the Course Tech Setup lecture. Here's a short article as an additional resource: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-requirementstxt-explained/
- Don't forget to set your requirements.txt file using pip freeze > requirements.txt

When you're done:

- Commit and push this code package to your GitHub account
    - A good practice is to use simple commit comments and commit code after you've finished each feature. Commit and push often

Submission: You will submit the GitHub URL for this repo in ELMS.

Grading: Ali and I will look to make sure you've output the correct print statements. We will only run main.py, so make sure to stucture this correctly. Credit will be given for adhering to the course's Code Standards and Data Standards, using GitHub correctly, and producing the correct output, among other considerations.
